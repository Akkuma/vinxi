# Client Router API

The `client` router is a wrapper for Viteâ€™s build processes and development server, allowing for easy integration with an `http` router for server-side rendering applications.

## Configuration Options

### type

- Value: `'client'`

### name

- Type: `string`
- Required: `true`

A unique identifier for the router.

### handler

- Type: `string`
- Required: `true`

The entry point file for the client application.

### base

- Type: `string`
- Required: `false`
- Default value: `'/'`

The base URL path under which the built assets for client application will be served.

::: tip
As client router is mostly built assets, its good to use `base` for namspacing these assets in order to avoid conflicts, eg. `"/_build"`

- Required: `false`

A function returning an array of Vite plugins to use during the build process.
